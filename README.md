6. Results & Business Recommendations
Key Results

Top 10 vendors contribute approximately 65.7% of total purchases, indicating vendor dependency risk

Bulk purchasing reduces average unit cost by approximately 72%

Unsold inventory represents a capital lock-in of approximately $2.71 million

Multiple vendors show high profit margins but low sales volume

Inventory turnover demonstrates weak correlation with profitability

Business Recommendations

Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce supply chain and operational risk

Re-evaluate pricing strategies for low-sales, high-margin vendors

Apply bulk purchasing selectively to balance cost savings and inventory efficiency

Reduce slow-moving inventory through optimized purchasing and clearance strategies

Strengthen marketing and distribution channels for underperforming vendors

7. Next Steps

Integrate real-time or near-real-time sales data for continuous monitoring

Extend analysis to include seasonality and demand forecasting

Implement automated alerts for declining vendor performance

Simulate alternative pricing strategies to optimize margin and sales volume
