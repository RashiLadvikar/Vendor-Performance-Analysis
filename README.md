# **Vendor Performance Analysis for Retail & Wholesale Optimization**

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

This project presents a comprehensive **Vendor Performance Analysis** aimed at improving profitability, inventory efficiency, and vendor decision-making in the retail and wholesale domain. Using exploratory data analysis and statistical validation, the study identifies key drivers of sales, profit margins, inventory turnover, and vendor dependency.

The analysis uncovers actionable insights such as over-reliance on a small group of vendors, inefficiencies in inventory movement, and opportunities for pricing and promotional optimization. These insights are translated into clear business recommendations to support strategic and operational decisions.

## **2. Business Problem**

Effective inventory and vendor management are critical to sustaining profitability in competitive retail and wholesale environments. Businesses often face challenges such as unsold inventory, inconsistent vendor performance, and margin erosion due to suboptimal pricing strategies.

### **Key Business Objectives**

* Identify underperforming brands requiring pricing or promotional adjustments
* Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit
* Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit cost reduction
* Evaluate inventory turnover to minimize holding costs
* Compare profitability patterns between high-performing and low-performing vendors

---

## **3. Methodology**

A structured, data-driven approach was followed to ensure reliable and business-relevant insights.

### **Data Understanding & Preparation**

* Reviewed vendor-level sales, purchase, pricing, and inventory metrics
* Identified missing values, zero sales records, and extreme outliers
* Filtered data to focus on profitable and active transactions

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Summary statistics to understand distribution and variability
* Detection of negative profit, zero sales, and high-cost anomalies
* Visualization of price, volume, freight cost, and turnover patterns

### **Analytical Techniques**

* Correlation analysis to assess relationships between pricing, sales, and profit
* Vendor segmentation based on sales contribution and profit margins
* Confidence interval analysis and hypothesis testing for margin comparison

## **5. Results & Business Recommendations**

### **Key Findings**

* A small group of top vendors contributes ~65% of total purchases, indicating dependency risk
* Several brands show high profit margins but low sales volume, suggesting pricing or visibility issues
* Bulk purchasing reduces unit costs by approximately 72%, improving profitability
* Significant capital is locked in slow-moving inventory, impacting cash flow
* High-selling vendors operate on lower margins compared to low-volume vendors

### **Business Recommendations**

* Re-evaluate pricing for low-sales, high-margin brands to drive volume growth
* Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce supply chain risk
* Leverage bulk purchasing strategically to maintain competitive pricing
* Optimize slow-moving inventory through demand-based purchasing and clearance strategies
* Improve marketing and distribution efforts for underperforming vendors

## **6. Statistical Validation**

To validate observed profitability differences, hypothesis testing was performed.

### **Hypothesis Testing**

* **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** No significant difference in profit margins between top and low-performing vendors
* **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** A significant difference exists between the two groups

### **Result**

* The null hypothesis was rejected, confirming statistically significant differences in profitability models

### **Business Implication**

* High-margin vendors benefit from pricing strength but lack volume
* High-volume vendors should focus on cost optimization to improve margins

---

## **7. Next Steps**

Future enhancements can further strengthen the analytical depth and business impact.

### **Proposed Extensions**

* Incorporate time-series analysis for seasonal demand patterns
* Build predictive models for vendor sales and inventory forecasting
* Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time vendor monitoring
* Integrate external data such as promotions, region, and customer demand
