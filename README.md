Vendor Performance & Profitability Analysis
1. Title

Vendor Performance & Profitability Analysis for Retail and Wholesale Operations

2. Executive Summary

This project focuses on evaluating vendor performance to support data-driven decision-making in retail and wholesale operations. The analysis examines sales, purchasing, inventory turnover, and profitability metrics to identify operational inefficiencies, vendor dependency risks, and margin optimization opportunities. By combining exploratory data analysis, statistical validation, and interactive dashboarding, the project delivers actionable business insights that can directly improve profitability and supply chain efficiency.

3. Business Problem

Efficient vendor and inventory management is critical to maintaining profitability in competitive retail and wholesale environments. Organizations often face challenges such as excessive reliance on a small group of vendors, slow-moving inventory, suboptimal pricing strategies, and inconsistent profit margins across suppliers.

The primary business objectives of this analysis are to:

Identify underperforming brands that require pricing or promotional adjustments

Determine top vendors contributing to total sales and gross profit

Analyze the financial impact of bulk purchasing on unit cost

Evaluate inventory turnover to reduce holding costs

Compare profitability between high-performing and low-performing vendors

4. Methodology

The project follows a structured analytics workflow to ensure accuracy and business relevance:

Data Preparation and Cleaning

Removed transactions with zero sales, negative gross profit, and undefined or negative profit margins

Filtered out non-contributing inventory to focus on meaningful business activity

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics to understand distribution and variability

Outlier detection for pricing, freight cost, and stock turnover

Correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between cost, sales, and profitability

Vendor Segmentation

Identification of top-performing vendors by sales and purchase contribution

Classification of low-performing vendors based on volume and profitability

Analysis of high-margin versus high-volume vendor groups

Statistical Validation

Hypothesis testing to confirm significant differences in profit margins between vendor segments

Visualization and Reporting

Development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders

5. Skills

6. Results & Business Recommendations
Key Results

The top 10 vendors account for approximately 65.7% of total purchases, highlighting a dependency risk

Bulk purchasing leads to an average unit cost reduction of approximately 72%

Unsold inventory represents a capital lock-in of approximately $2.71 million

Several vendors exhibit high profit margins but low sales volume, indicating pricing or distribution inefficiencies

Inventory turnover shows weak correlation with profitability, challenging the assumption that faster turnover always leads to higher margins

Business Recommendations

Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce supply chain and operational risk

Re-evaluate pricing strategies for low-sales, high-margin vendors to improve volume without sacrificing profitability

Leverage bulk purchasing strategically to balance cost savings with inventory efficiency

Reduce slow-moving inventory through optimized purchase planning or clearance strategies

Enhance marketing and distribution efforts for underperforming vendors

7. Next Steps

Integrate real-time or near-real-time sales data for continuous vendor monitoring

Extend analysis to include seasonality and demand forecasting

Automate alerts for declining vendor performance

Simulate alternative pricing strategies to optimize margin and volume balance
